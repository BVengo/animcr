# AnimCR
I've read a lot of scientific papers, and often find myself struggling to fully understand them whilst looking at a wall of text. This project is merely my own tests at learning the animation package MANIM, as an exploration into better methods for visualising complicated topics.

The name `AnimCR` is a reference to the work I am currently performing; removing cosmic rays (CRs) from astronomical images. These simulations all relate to that work in some way (even if not explicitly discussed), such as demonstrating how convolutional kernels are applied to an image.
